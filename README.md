## 📌 What Is JJSploit?

JJSploit is a Roblox exploit made by **WeAreDevs (WRD)**.  

It claims to offer script execution, GUIs like Dex, and one-click hacks for beginner.

But behind the flashy marketing lies

- frequent detection
  
- dangerous installers
  
- malware flags (including **Wacatac**)
  
- and unstable performance that ruins systems.
  

---

## 🚫 1. Constant Detection

- Breaks with nearly every Roblox update.
  
- Frequent errors like `DLL Failed to Inject`, or instant game crashes.
  
- Delays in WRD patching = users left hanging for hours or days.
  
- Players report getting **kicked or banned** despite WRD's "undetected" claims.
  

---

## 🪳 2. Instability and Bugs

- Crashes during script execution.
  
- Dex, SimpleSpy, and other tools often don't work.
  
- Menu items glitch or overlap.
  
- Freezes Roblox or even your whole PC.
  

> 🧠 ChatGPT’s note:

> This isn't just annoying — it's a **system risk**.

> Repeated DLL injection with no memory handling can lead to instability or even corrupt your session.

## 🕷️ 3. Malware Risk – Wacatac Trojan

**⚠️ Detected as: Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml**

### What Is Wacatac?

Wacatac is a **trojan malware** that:

- disguises itself as normal software,
  
- steals passwords and clipboard data,
  
- installs more malware,
  
- can link your system to a botnet.
  

> Even if it’s a “false positive,” the installer has used adware-style wrappers known to drop junkware and spyware.

---

## 🧪 4. Poor Feature Quality

- Most features are **copy-pasted** from public GitHubs or forums.
  
- No sandbox, no error fallback, no decompiler.
  
- Script Hub full of broken, outdated code.
  
- Cannot compete with real tools that prioritize performance and safety.

## 💰 5. WRD’s Business Model: Bloat + Bait

WRD uses JJSploit to promote paid/partnered exploits:

- **Evon**
  
- **Hydrogen**
  
- **Delta**

These tools often have the same core flaws:
- crash-prone,
  
- bloated with key systems,
  
- filled with false “premium” marketing.
